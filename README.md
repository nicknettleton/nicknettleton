Hi, I'm Nick.

I'm a Strategic Technology Leader & Architect with a passion for building impactful, human-centred experiences.

After 18+ years as a founder and CEO/CTO - leading national-scale platforms with orgs like the NHS and FastTrack 100 winner Cyclescheme - I'm now focused on hands-on, high-impact work at the intersection of **AI, Product Design, and Engineering**.

### 🏆 My Work in AI & Explainability

I am particularly interested in **Responsible & Explainable AI (XAI)** - for example combing human-centred design with technical work to solve explainability challenges.

You can see my work in my pinned repositories:

* **[PREPARE-Challenge](https://github.com/nicknettleton/PREPARE-Challenge)**: My NIH Explainability Prize-winning solution.
* **[Cognitive-Capacity-Prediction](https://github.com/nicknettleton/Cognitive-Capacity-Prediction)**: A follow-up XAI model for predicting future cognitive capacity.
